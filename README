This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Sweepline Algorithm for 
All Nearest Neighbors in the plane.

The implementation uses two interesting self-adjusting data
structures, splay trees and skew heaps.  These were both developed by
my PhD advisor Danny Sleator and his advisor Bob Tarjan.  They are
both explained in Wikipedia.

The repository contains the following files:

sweepnn.cpp
This is the C++ source for the sweepline algorithm.

class notes.pdf
These are some old class notes written when I taught this algorithm in
a data structures course. 

allfigs.pdf
Figures that go with the class notes.

allfigs.ps
PostScript file for the figures.    (Remember PostScript?)

pictures.pdf 
These diagrams trace the algorithm step by step through a
set of a couple of dozen points.

pictures.ps
A PostScript file for the diagrams.

points1000
A set of 1000 points that you may wish to use as an example input.

slowann.cpp
C++ source for the naive quadratic algorithm for all nearest neighbors.
You can use this to convince yourself that the sweepline algorithm is correct.

Please drop me a line if you make use of this.  You are free to use it
for any purpose consisten with academic integrity -- meaning that you
won't turn it in as your own work in a class.
